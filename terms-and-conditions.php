            <p>Welcome to Designatrix! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website, services, and any related content or communication you receive from us. By accessing or using our website and services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
            <p>If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please do not use our services.</p>
            <h3>Services Provided</h3>
            <p>Designatrix offers digital services including web design, logo design, e-commerce development, SEO, social media marketing (SMM), branding, and mobile app development. Each project is subject to its own scope of work, timeline, and payment terms as outlined in your proposal or service agreement.</p>
            <h3>User Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>You agree to provide accurate, up-to-date information and necessary assets (text, images, logins, etc.) required to complete your project. Delays in communication or asset delivery may affect project timelines.</p>
            <p>You agree not to use our services for any unlawful, harmful, or fraudulent purposes.</p>
            <h3>Payments & Refunds</h3>
            <p>All payments must be made according to the agreed-upon schedule in your proposal or invoice. We may require a deposit or upfront payment before starting work.</p>
            <p>Due to the nature of creative and digital work, <strong>all payments are non-refundable</strong> once the work has started. If you cancel a project after work has begun, you are responsible for any work completed up to that point.</p>
            <h3>Revisions</h3>
            <p>We offer a set number of revisions per project, typically outlined in your agreement. Excessive revisions or major changes outside of the original scope may incur additional charges.</p>
            <h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p>Upon full payment, all original design and content created for you becomes your property. However, Designatrix retains the right to display the work in our portfolio, social media, or promotional materials unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
            <p>You are responsible for ensuring any content you provide (e.g., images, videos, fonts) is properly licensed or owned by you.</p>
            <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>We respect your privacy and confidentiality. Any information shared with us during the course of a project will be treated as confidential and not shared with third parties without your consent.</p>
            <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>Designatrix will not be held liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use of our services. We do not guarantee specific results (e.g., #1 Google ranking or guaranteed sales) unless explicitly stated in a contract.</p>
            <h3>Termination</h3>
            <p>Either party may terminate a project with written notice. In such cases, you agree to pay for work completed up to the termination date. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate services if these Terms are violated.</p>
            <h3>Third-Party Tools & Services</h3>
            <p>We may integrate third-party tools (e.g., payment processors, plugins, APIs). We are not responsible for any issues caused by these external tools or providers.</p>
            <h3>Changes to Terms</h3>
            <p>Designatrix reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of significant changes, and your continued use of our services after updates constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>
            <h3>Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the respective US state. Any disputes arising shall be resolved in the courts of the respective Legal Jurisdiction.</p>
            <h3>Contact Us</h3>
